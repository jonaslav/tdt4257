1 Introduction
In this report, we will examine the governance of the Foodora platform ecosystem, which entails
discussing its purpose, dimensions, and its relationship with platform architecture. Additionally,
we will explore the platform’s perceived value from the perspective of two relevant actors, namely
consumers and restaurants. Furthermore, we will provide reflections on the platform’s long-term
sustainability, challenges with delivery drivers, and its environmental impact.
2 Platform governance
Governance is how a platform owner influences its ecosystem (Tiwana 2014). The platform owner
seeks to orchestrate the platform rather than control it. Governance can reduce behavioral com-
plexity, much like platform architecture reduces structural complexity.
2.1 Purpose of platform governance
While both innovation and transaction platforms require effective governance to function prop-
erly, the specific purposes of governance differ. Governance in innovation platforms is focused
on fostering creativity and collaboration, while governance in transaction platforms is focused on
facilitating efficient and secure transactions.
For Foodora, the purpose of governance will therefore be to ensure that the platform is efficient,
secure, transparent, and fair for all parties involved in transactions. Transaction platforms typically
rely on more centralized governance models that establish rules, policies, and procedures to govern
how the platform operates and how its participants interact with each other. The governance of
a transaction platform is aimed at providing a trusted and reliable environment for buyers and
sellers to conduct transactions.
2.2 Relationship with platform architecture
All the dimensions of platform governance, which will be discussed in the next section, must be
aligned with its architecture, as governance structures are strategically inseparable from platform
architecture (Tiwana 2014). How well a governance structure can work depends on whether it is
aligned well with the platform’s architecture, the stage of its life cycle, and its business model.
According to Tiwana (2014) can a misalignment in any one of the three governance dimensions
lead to a collapse of the ecosystem.
2.3 Platform governance dimensions
2.3.1 Decision rights partitioning
Platform governance encompasses three dimensions. The first is decision rights partitioning, which
is the division of authority and responsibilities between the platform owner and app developers,
meaning who makes what decisions (Tiwana 2014). A decision right can belong either to the
platform owner or the app developer, or anywhere in between. It is rarely completely one or the
other who has the decision right, but rather that both have some authority and responsibility for
most decisions.
Within Foodora, the platform owner has the ultimate authority and decision-making power over
the platform. This includes setting the terms and conditions for app developers to access and use
the platform, as well as establishing policies and procedures for the operation and management of
the platform (foodora 2023). App developers, on the other hand, are responsible for developing
and maintaining the apps that run on the platform. This includes ensuring that their apps comply
with Foodora’s terms and conditions, as well as maintaining the quality and performance of their
apps over time. The decision rights are quite centralized, meaning that most of the authority and
responsibilities lie with the platform owner.
2.3.2 Control portfolio configuration
The second dimension is the control portfolio configuration. This is the collection of mechanisms
through which the platform owner exercises control over app developers (Tiwana 2014). There
are four control mechanisms described by Tiwana (2014): three formal and one informal. The
formal control mechanisms include control through gatekeeping, process control, and control using
metrics, while the informal control mechanism is relational control.
Foodora uses these control mechanisms to control their delivery drivers and the restaurants on
the app. The first control mechanism, gatekeeping, reserves bouncer rights to Foodora over what
restaurants can be included as part of the ecosystem. A restaurant has to apply to be a part of the
Foodora app, and Foodora can choose to accept or reject the restaurant. This gives Foodora the
possibility to choose which restaurants they think will meet their requirements (foodora partner
2023).
The second formal control mechanism is process control. This refers to the degree to which the
platform owner rewards or penalizes app developers based on the degree to which they follow
prescribed development methods, rules, and procedures that it believes will lead to outcomes de-
sirable from a platform owner’s perspective (Tiwana 2014). As the app developers are employees at
Foodora, Foodora has complete control over the process and can decide how much their employees
should follow their development methods and rules.
The last formal control mechanism is metrics. This refers to the degree to which the platform owner
rewards or penalizes app developers based on the degree to which the outcomes of their work achieve
predefined target performance metrics (Tiwana 2014). Foodora uses this control mechanism on
their delivery drivers. As discussed in delivery 2, Foodora rewards their best-performing drivers,
giving them first pick for shifts, and punishing their bottom performers (Chau 2018).
The informal control mechanism of relational control refers to the degree to which the platform
owner relies on norms and values that it shares with app developers to influence their behavior
(Tiwana 2014). Foodora relies on a combination of employees and independent contractors to op-
erate its business. It would probably be easier to exert relational control over their own employees,
as they can have a common culture within the company, than over the independent contractors.
2.3.3 Pricing policies
The third and last dimension is the pricing policies. These are the decisions about how proceeds
will be divvied up between a platform owner and app developers (Tiwana 2014). The restaurants
pay Foodora 30% of the order price to Foodora but benefit from a difference in tax (Miltok 2016).
This means that Foodora uses pie splitting with a fixed rate. The collaboration with Foodora is a
lucrative way for the restaurants to get additional revenues, as the employees, food, and equipment
are already in place. They could have a full restaurant and still serve more customers. It is also
lucrative for Foodora, as they only have to pay the delivery driver, so it is a good solution for both
the restaurants and Foodora.

3 Perceived value
3.1 Consumers
Consumers are a critical component of the Foodora ecosystem, as they represent the primary
user base of the application. These are the people that browse and order food from one of the
restaurants, also often utilizing the delivery service offered by Foodora. The consumers’ role is not
limited to just ordering food, as they also provide valuable feedback and ratings on the quality of
the food, delivery experience, and overall service provided by the platform.
3.1.1 Collecting empirical data about consumers
The team conducted user interviews to collect empirical data about what consumers thought about
Foodora. To ensure the reliability and validity of data, the team developed a structured interview
plan and recruited a diverse sample of users who had both used and not used Foodora to order
food in the past. The chosen test subjects consist of the team members’ friends and family, all
belonging to different age groups and in different areas of work or study. A total of 5 interviews
were conducted in the collection of empirical data.
During the interviews, the team asked questions about users’ experiences with Foodora, including
when they use it, why they use it, and how frequently they used the platform. Those who did
not utilize the application were asked about their reasons for not using it and what features the
application could offer to encourage them to use it. The team also asked follow-up questions to
gather more specific information and insights. The data was then recorded and analyzed to identify
common themes and patterns from the users.
3.1.2 The perceived value of the platform by the consumers
Through analyzing the user interviews, the team has concluded that there are several factors that
both motivate and discourage users from choosing food delivery services over more traditional
options like physically visiting restaurants or preparing meals at home. Therefore, the perceived
value of the food delivery platform by consumers varies depending on individual preferences and
needs.
Firstly, it was discovered that the ease and convenience of ordering food online through a mobile
app or website is a major draw for busy individuals who don’t have the time or energy to plan for
and cook meals. The application is easily accessible through its simple and user-friendly interface
which in turn makes it fast and simple to browse and order. Furthermore, Foodora assures that
the food is safely delivered directly to a consumer’s door removing the need to commute to the
restaurant’s location to collect their orders such as with traditional takeout.
Additionally, food delivery services offer various restaurants serving different cuisines and menu
options. This allows users to try and discover new dishes and culinary cultures that they otherwise
would not explore. By gathering all the nearby restaurants into a single application, users can
easily obtain a comprehensive overview of the available options. According to multiple users, the
ability to browse and select from a variety of venues was a significant factor in their decision to
use the platform. They also noted that this increased level of freedom resulted in a more enjoyable
and satisfying dining experience
Finally, the study revealed that several consumers utilized Foodora’s food delivery service in social
contexts, such as get-togethers with friends and family or celebratory occasions like birthdays and
anniversaries. These findings suggest that food delivery services are not only valued for their
convenience but can also enhance social interactions and experiences. Overall, the ability to bring
people together over a shared meal is a significant benefit of food delivery services like Foodora.
All these factors combined make food delivery services an attractive and popular choice among
users. However, despite the advantages of food delivery services, there are several reasons why
3
consumers may opt not to use them. For instance, some of the individuals interviewed stated
that they did not use the platform regularly because they preferred to cook their meals at home,
either due to enjoying the process of cooking or for health reasons. A significant proportion of the
restaurants on food delivery platforms tend to offer fast food options that contain high levels of
refined sugar and processed oils. This factor, along with concerns about the freshness and quality
of the delivered food, can be a deterrent for some users. As such, individuals who prioritize their
fitness goals may decide to prepare healthy, whole-food meals at home instead of using food delivery
apps.
Furthermore, while food delivery services provide convenience and accessibility, the cost can be
a significant barrier for some individuals. Delivery fees and service charges can add up quickly,
making the overall cost of a meal significantly more expensive than if it were prepared at home.
Moreover, some food delivery services require a minimum order amount, which may not be practical
for those on a budget or those who only require a small meal. For these reasons, the cost of food
delivery services may be too high for some individuals, causing them to opt for alternative dining
options.
3.2 Restaurants
Restaurants play a crucial role in the success of food delivery companies like Foodora. As a food
delivery platform, Foodora relies on the quality and variety of restaurants in its ecosystem to
satisfy its customers’ varied culinary needs. Restaurants are the main food suppliers to Foodora,
and their menus determine the range of options available for their customers to order from. In
addition, restaurants are responsible for preparing and packaging food to be delivered to customers
in a timely and professional manner. Therefore, the quality of food and service provided by
restaurants has a direct impact on the overall customer experience and reputation of Foodora.
Successful partnerships with recognized and popular restaurants can drive customer loyalty and
lead to increased income for both the restaurant and Foodora.
3.2.1 Collecting empirical data about restaurants
Interviews were conducted to collect empirical data about restaurants’ opinions about Foodora.
The team contacted multiple restaurants from Oslo with a diverse variety of cuisines such as fast
food chains and ethnic restaurants to ensure that a wide broad of restaurants that use Foodora is
represented. The interviews were conducted by contacting the restaurants in person around the
city center of Oslo with a set of questions prepared to be answered.
The interview questions focused on restaurants’ overall thoughts about Foodora, why they use
Foodora, its advantages and disadvantages, and how the Foodora ecosystem affected how busy the
restaurant was. The goal of the interviews was to gather an overview of how restaurants perceive
Foodora and further specific questions related to restaurants were asked to gather more details and
insights.
3.2.2 The perceived value of the platform by restaurants
Analyzing the data gathered from restaurants, multiple factors were found about restaurants’
perceptions of Foodora and food delivery companies in general. The common perception is the
ease of use and the convenience Foodora brings to restaurants, as well as the issues regarding to
pick-up time and payments to restaurants.
Restaurants have traditionally been a business where transactions have been made physically inside
the restaurant, and customers have had no choice but to travel to the restaurant to order and
consume the food. With technological advancements, some restaurants facilitated home delivery
with their own delivery staff and ordering options through the phone or Internet. The challenge
of home delivery with in-house delivery staff is the need to have enough staff at any given time,
which drives up the expenses of the restaurant. Additionally, having an ordering system by phone
4
and/or through the Internet requires restaurants to invest in advertisements in order to expand
their customer base. Foodora solves these issues, where the restaurant does not have to maintain
a delivery staff, as it is delivered by Foodora. Foodora ecosystem also enables customers to find
any restaurant that uses the platform with recommendations and rating systems, which makes it
easier for restaurants to advertise themselves to expand their customer base.
In order for Foodora to maintain its operations as well as its growth, a delivery fee is taken from the
customer, as well as the restaurants to facilitate the services. One of the major issues restaurants
are facing with Foodora, is the percentage cut they take from the orders. Multiple restaurants
have complained about this during the interview, pointing out the small margins that restaurants
already operate with and the true expense of home delivery companies like Foodora. When asked
during the interviews about why the restaurants still use Foodora considering the small margins,
all of the restaurants pointed out the importance of food delivery companies during Covid-19 and
the size of their customer base because of Foodora.
Restaurants that are in the Foodora ecosystem, rely heavily on Foodora to expand and operate their
businesses. Restaurants perceive Foodora as a platform to conduct business and have become more
and more dependent on food delivery companies to grow their business, as the home delivery market
is growing at speed. Restaurants’ experience with Foodora however, is somewhat bittersweet. The
ecosystem itself provides a great platform for restaurants to advertise and conduct business, but
the fee to enter the ecosystem and the delivery issues that arise is the biggest challenge restaurants
are facing.
4 Additional reflections
As we delve deeper into the Foodora platform ecosystem and its governance, it is essential to
recognize the broader implications of the platform’s impact on various stakeholders. This additional
reflection section will discuss the long-term sustainability of the Foodora platform, the challenges
faced by delivery drivers, and the potential environmental impact of food delivery services.
4.1 Long-term Sustainability of the Foodora Platform
The long-term sustainability of the Foodora platform is contingent upon the ability to adapt and
evolve with the changing market landscape. The platform must continually evaluate its governance
structure and policies, striking a balance between maintaining control over the ecosystem and
fostering innovation and growth. The platform must also remain vigilant to emerging trends and
competition, ensuring that it remains an attractive option for both consumers and restaurants.
One area where Foodora can focus on long-term sustainability is by cultivating strong relationships
with the restaurants in its ecosystem. By investing in support services, providing better data and
insights, and offering innovative marketing solutions, Foodora can become a valuable partner to
the restaurants, helping them to grow and succeed in an increasingly competitive environment.
Additionally, Foodora should explore opportunities to diversify its revenue streams, potentially
expanding into other services such as catering. This would not only increase the platform’s overall
revenue but also create additional value for its ecosystem partners.
4.2 Challenges Faced by Delivery Drivers
While the Foodora platform has brought convenience and choice to consumers and new revenue
opportunities for restaurants, it is essential to consider the challenges faced by the delivery drivers
who are the backbone of the platform. These drivers are often classified as independent contractors,
which means they may not receive the same benefits and protections as traditional employees.
Some of the challenges faced by delivery drivers include low and unstable income, lack of job
5
security, and inadequate support from the platform. To address these issues, Foodora should
consider exploring alternative employment models for its delivery drivers, providing better support
and resources, and ensuring fair compensation.
Moreover, Foodora should take a proactive approach to improve working conditions for its delivery
drivers. This could include implementing performance-based incentives, providing access to train-
ing and development opportunities, and ensuring that drivers have a safe and secure environment
in which to work.
4.3 Environmental Impact of Food Delivery Services
As food delivery services such as Foodora continue to grow in popularity, it is important to con-
sider the potential environmental impact of this trend. The increased use of single-use packaging
materials, coupled with increased vehicle emissions from delivery vehicles, can have a negative
impact on the environment.
Foodora, as an industry leader, has a responsibility to address these environmental concerns and
should look for ways to minimize its ecological footprint. This could include partnering with
restaurants to implement more sustainable packaging solutions, incentivizing the use of eco-friendly
delivery vehicles, and promoting environmentally conscious practices among its delivery drivers.
Furthermore, the platform could also explore innovative solutions such as offering customers the
option to offset their carbon footprint through tree-planting initiatives or investing in renewable
energy projects.
