1	Case
In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, platform governance has emerged as a critical factor in the success and sustainability of online platforms. This essay focuses on the case of Foodora, a popular food delivery platform. The motivation for this study stems from the increasing influence of such platforms on our daily lives and the economy at large. However, the governance of these platforms and its impact on various stakeholders remains a complex and underexplored area. The problem statement for this essay, therefore, is to understand how platform governance in Foodora impacts its key stakeholders: consumers, restaurants, and delivery drivers.
1.1	Summary of the group assignment
Our group assignment involved a comprehensive analysis of Foodora's platform ecosystem. We examined its governance structure, the perceived value from the perspective of consumers and restaurants, and reflected on the platform's long-term sustainability, challenges with delivery drivers, and environmental impact. The findings revealed a complex interplay of governance mechanisms that significantly influence the experiences and perceptions of the platform's stakeholders.
1.2	Theme
The theme I want to focus on is "Platform Governance and its Impact on Stakeholders". This theme explores the question: "How does the governance of the Foodora platform impact its key stakeholders, and what are the implications for the platform's sustainability and success?"
1.3	Motivation
The motivation to focus on this theme stems from two main factors. From an academic perspective, platform governance is a relatively new field of study. As digital platforms continue to proliferate and dominate various sectors, understanding the mechanisms of their governance and the implication for stakeholders becomes increasingly important. This study contributes to the growing body of literature in this area.
From a practical standpoint, insights from this study can inform platform owners, policymakers, and stakeholders about the impacts of platform governance. This understanding can guide decision-making processes, policy development, and strategies to enhance the value and sustainability of digital platforms. Given the growing influence of platforms like Foodora, this study holds significant relevance for both the digital economy and society at large.
2	Review of the literature
The theme of "Platform Governance and its Impact on Stakeholders" is a multifaceted topic that has been explored in various academic literature. The following review is organized around key concepts related to this theme, namely: platform architecture, platform governance, and the co-evolution of platforms and their environment.
2.1	Platform Architecture
The architecture of a software platform is a critical determinant of its functionality and adaptability. Baldwin and Woodard (2009) posit that platform architecture is typically modular, allowing for flexibility and scalability [6]. This modularity enables individual components to be updated or replaced without disrupting the entire platform, fostering an environment of continuous innovation and improvement. He and Kettinger, and William (2021) underscores the importance of a well-designed architecture in ensuring the robustness and adaptability of a software platform.
2.2	Platform Governance
Platform governance, the rules and processes that control how the platform is used and developed, is another key concept in the literature. Boudreau (2010) discusses the importance of decision rights, control mechanisms, and proprietary versus shared ownership in platform governance [2]. These elements determine who has the authority to make decisions, how behaviors are encouraged or discouraged, and who owns the platform and its components. Tiwana (2014) further elaborates on this, highlighting the delicate balance required in platform governance to ensure the integrity of the platform while encouraging innovation.
2.3	Co-evolution of Platforms and their Environment
The co-evolution of software platforms and their environment is a concept that has gained traction in recent years. Rochet and Tirole (2003) suggest that platforms and their environments influence each other in a reciprocal manner [3]. As the platform evolves, it shapes its environment by creating new market opportunities or influencing user behaviors. Conversely, changes in the environment can drive the evolution of the platform. Tiwana et al. (2010) supports this view, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between platforms and their environment.
3	Discussion
The problem of platform governance and its impact on stakeholders is a complex and multifaceted issue that has significant implications for the success and sustainability of software platforms. The literature review presented in the previous section highlighted three key concepts related to this problem: platform architecture, platform governance, and the co-evolution of platforms and their environment.
Platform architecture, as discussed in the works of Baldwin and Woodard (2009) and He and Kettinger, and William (2021), is a critical determinant of a platform's functionality and adaptability. A well-designed, modular architecture allows for flexibility and scalability, enabling individual components to be updated or replaced without disrupting the entire platform. This fosters an environment of continuous innovation and improvement, which is crucial in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.
However, the architecture alone is not sufficient to ensure the success of a platform. Effective platform governance, as discussed in the works of Boudreau (2010) and Tiwana (2014) is also essential. Platform governance involves a delicate balance of decision rights, control mechanisms, and proprietary versus shared ownership. Striking the right balance in these areas can ensure the integrity of the platform while encouraging innovation and participation from various stakeholders.
The co-evolution of platforms and their environment is another important aspect of this problem. As suggested by Rochet and Tirole (2003) and Tiwana (2014), platforms and their environments influence each other in a reciprocal manner. As the platform evolves, it shapes its environment by creating new market opportunities or influencing user behaviors. Conversely, changes in the environment can drive the evolution of the platform. Understanding this dynamic interplay can provide valuable insights for the development and management of successful software platforms.
3.1	Concluding Reflections
Reflecting on the problem of platform governance and its impact on stakeholders, this is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding of various interrelated concepts. The architecture and governance of a platform, along with its co-evolution with its environment, are key factors that determine its success and impact.
However, it is also clear that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. The optimal architecture, governance structure, and evolution strategy can vary greatly depending on the specific characteristics of the platform and its environment. Therefore, it is crucial for platform owners and managers to have a deep understanding of their platform and its environment, and to be able to adapt and evolve their strategies as needed.
Furthermore, while the literature provides valuable insights into this problem, there is still much to be learned. As digital platforms continue to proliferate and dominate various sectors, further research is needed to deepen our understanding of platform governance and its impact on stakeholders. This research could explore, for example, how different types of platforms (e.g., open vs. closed, consumer vs. enterprise) might require different governance strategies, or how changes in the broader digital landscape (e.g., new technologies, regulatory changes) might impact platform governance.
In conclusion, the problem of platform governance and its impact on stakeholders is a complex and multifaceted issue that is crucial to the success and sustainability of software platforms. By deepening our understanding of this problem and continuing to explore new strategies and solutions, we can help to ensure the continued growth and success of these platforms, and to maximize their value for all stakeholders.
