1 Introduction
This delivery will discuss the evolution of Foodora as a platform ecosystem, including a timeline of
important events and an overview of modular operators performed on the platform. Four events
that the group finds especially important in shaping the trajectory of the platform will also be
discussed in detail.
2 Part I: Timeline of important events
The following section will detail a timeline of the most important events in the evolution of Foodora
from its establishment in 2015 until today. Table 1 gives an overview of all important years and a
description of their corresponding events.
Table 1: Timeline of Foodora
Feb 2014 Founted under the name Volo GmbH in Munich
Apr 2014 Acquired by Rocket Internet and relocated to Berlin
Sep 2015 Acquired by Delivery Hero. Foodora then merged with Delivery Hero’s
upscale food delivery brand, Urban Taste, under the name Foodora
Sep 2015 Acquired a local delivery company in Australia called Suppertime,
later re-branding it in May of the same year
2015 Established operations in Sweden, Finland and Norway
2018 Launched extended areas around the cities where the
restaurants deliver the food themselves
Nov 2018 Foodora lost an unfair dismissal case, as the court ruled that its drivers were classed as
employees rather than contractors.
2018 Closing business in Australia following legal proceedings and controversy surrounding
workers.
2018 Closing business in the Netherlands following unsuccessful attempts to find an interested
buyer and competition from Takeaway.com.
2019 Encreased activity with the covid-19 pandemic in the Nordic countries.
Jun 2020 Data breach at Delivery Hero, where over 700.000 passwords were stolen.
2020 Closed business in Canada, following drivers’ campaign to unionize and
longtime unsustainable operations.
2021 Started a new grocery concept called Foodora market
Mar 2021 Introduced the first autonomous delivery robot into its fleet in Stockholm
2022 Acquires Hungry DK and establishes Foodora in Denmark. Continues to
expand in the Nordic countries,
with more cities and extended areas.
Jan 2022 The Norwegian Competition Authority rules that Foodora can not have exclusive
agreements with restaurants [Brunborg 2022].
All the listed events have in one way or another shaped Foodora into the platform ecosystem it is
today. The most important enabling factors include the acquisition by Delivery Hero and following
rebranding to Foodora, the start-up in the Nordic countries and the boost in activity following
the Covid-19 pandemic. All these factors lead to an increase in user mass and activity. The more
users on the platform, the more restaurants become locked in as a result of network effects. This
is because they are more inclined to take part to gain access to the growing digital market and as
1
such reach customers.
However, the platform also faced some difficulties, namely multiple strikes and the closing of
business in several countries. The biggest difficulty for Foodora has been to satisfy the demands
of delivery drivers while also keeping delivery fees low for customers.
3 Part II: Modular operators
Modular operators can be described as discrete actions to be performed in modularized platform
ecosystems in order to incrementally refine and develop the ecosystem [Tiwana 2014]. There are
five different modular operators, namely split, subtract, substitute, augment and mutate. Foodora
has made use of augment and mutate in its lifecycle, and the following section will detail how
Foodora has used these operators to expand the ecosystem.
3.1 Augment
The AUGMENT operator consists of adding new subsystems into a platform’s ecosystem and
directly corresponds with the real option of expanding or scaling a business’ operations. The new
systems that are added aim to provide new functionality to the platform without having to make
any changes elsewhere in the system. In addition to adding new capabilities, this operator allows
for expanding and further developing different subsystems in their own respective time aspect.
Foodoras’ growth model is based on expanding its platform and services to new locations within
the countries they operate. This can be viewed as a use case of the augment operator with the new
subsystems being all systems needed for the expansion. The reason for this is that each new city
is its own separate entity with a unique set of restaurants. The common denominator is that the
systems themselves are similar and have corresponding functionality. The inclusion of new cities
does therefore not require any changes to different subsystems connected to other cities.
Another use of the augment operator is the inclusion of regular stores and the Foodora marketplace.
These subsystems allow Foodora to provide new capabilities to each city, attracting a larger user
mass. These subsystems are also connected to their respective cities, however, the functionality is
split from the functionality connected to restaurants.
3.2 Mutate
The MUTATE operator involves making a copy of the original system in order to create a derivative
system made for a different application domain. A special case of the MUTATE operator is the
PORT operator, which involves replicating the functionality of an app in order to make it function
on a different platform than it originally was implemented for [Tiwana 2014, p.195].
Foodora has made use of the porting operator given that the ecosystem consists of both a mobile
application and a webpage. Both systems allow customers to order dishes from restaurants or
grocery items from Foodora market. The advantage of porting is that the application does not
need to be entirely redesigned for each of the different target platforms. The process of making
the apps available on different platforms ensures that as many customers as possible have access
to Foodora.
Furthermore, Foodora has apps for both Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Developing platform-
specific applications would limit Foodora’s reach as most people primarily only use one operating
system. This knowledge was most likely a driver for Foodora making applications for all devices
when it initially launched. Being able to reach the most amount of people as possible ensured the
best starting point to be able to grow and expand in the long run. This also ensured a consistent
user experience across devices from the beginning.

3.3 Substitute
The SUBSTITUTE operator enables the replacement of one subsystem (app) with another within
an ecosystem without affecting the overall system. It requires internal modularity and can facil-
itate rapid evolution and competition among apps in platform ecosystems. This operator gives
ecosystems a plug-and-play property, allowing the easy swapping of apps [Tiwana 2014, p.192].
Foodora has strategically employed the SUBSTITUTE operator to expand its ecosystem by con-
tinuously improving and diversifying its range of services. By implementing a modular structure,
Foodora has made it possible to replace or upgrade individual apps within its platform without
disrupting its overall functionality. This has allowed the platform to adapt and grow, catering to
the ever-changing demands of customers and industry trends.
• Enhancing customer experience: Foodora has used the SUBSTITUTE operator to replace
or upgrade apps responsible for food recommendations, user interfaces, and order tracking.
This ensures that customers always have access to the most advanced, user-friendly, and
feature-rich solutions, ultimately elevating their experience.
• Expanding restaurant offerings: Foodora has leveraged the SUBSTITUTE operator to swap
out or improve apps that manage relationships with partner restaurants. By doing so, they
have streamlined onboarding processes, increased efficiency in communication, and enhanced
data analysis capabilities, all of which contribute to a more diverse and robust selection of
restaurants for customers to choose from.
• Improving delivery logistics: Foodora has utilized the SUBSTITUTE operator to optimize
apps related to delivery management, route optimization, and real-time tracking. By con-
tinually updating these apps with more advanced solutions, Foodora ensures that its delivery
services are efficient, reliable, and aligned with customer expectations.
• Encouraging app developer competition: By embracing the SUBSTITUTE operator, Foodora
has fostered a competitive environment among app developers. This has led to the creation
of better, more innovative apps and services, as developers strive to outperform their rivals
and secure a place within Foodora’s ecosystem.
In conclusion, Foodora’s application of the SUBSTITUTE operator has allowed the company
to expand its ecosystem by promoting innovation, diversifying services, and improving overall
platform performance. This approach has positioned Foodora as a leading player in the food
delivery industry, adapting and evolving to meet the needs of both customers and partners.
4 Part III: Four episodes from the timeline in detail
The following section considers four important episodes along the timeline of Foodora. Each of
these episodes played an important role in shaping the platform’s main objectives, as well as the
evolution of the platform ecosystems as a whole.
4.1 Episode 1: Acquisition
Foodora was acquired by Rocket Internet in 2014 alongside several other food delivery plat-
forms worldwide, such as Hurrier (Canada) and Suppertime (Australia) which operated under
the Foodora brand. In 2015, Delivery Hero acquired Foodora from Rocket Internet [Chau and
Kontominas 2023] and merged with Delivery Hero’s food delivery brand, Urban Taste under the
Foodora brand.
The acquisition of Foodora was seen as a milestone within Delivery Hero to further expand to new
markets in Europe, North America and Australia. In Europe, Delivery Hero gained foothold in the
3
scandinavian marked through Foodora and its existing brand, which is clear to see today where
Foodora is one of the leading food delivery companies with thousands of restaurants and shops
within their ecosystem.
Foodora, under Delivery Hero set to aggressively expand and advertize their brand to restaurants
and consumers, and with a larger budget from Delivery Hero, Foodora had the possibility to grow
and become established in their operation area. Investments from Delivery Hero led to a growing
Foodora with new restaurants, delivery personell, Foodora markets and other features that are in
the ecosystem today.
4.2 Episode 2: Strikes
The strikes against Foodora were initiated by its delivery riders in response to concerns over
low pay, lack of benefits, and poor working conditions. In particular, the riders were classified
as independent contractors rather than employees, which meant that they were not entitled to
benefits such as sick leave, workers’ compensation, or minimum wage protections. The strikes
took place in several countries where the company operated, including Australia, Germany, and
Canada. The strikes began in 2017 and continued into 2018, with delivery riders demanding better
working conditions, higher pay, and employee status.
In Australia in November 2018, Foodora lost an unfair dismissal case against a former delivery
driver Josh Klooger [Chau and Kontominas 2018]. The Fair Work Commission (TWC) decided that
Foodora had terminated the Klooger’s contract in a ”harsh, unjust and unreasonable” manner after
he had spoken out about Foodora’s worsening pay and conditions. Since he had started working
for Foodora, the pay had gone from $14 per hour plus $5 per delivery to $7 per delivery and no
hourly wage. He spoke about this publicly, in addition to creating an online chatroom to discuss
the company’s low pay and working conditions. When Klooger refused to hand over access rights
to this chatroom, Foodora terminated his contract immediately. He then sued for unfair dismissal
and won, and Foodora was ordered to pay him almost $16.000 in compensation.
While working on this case, the TWC noticed Foodora’s ”batch” system [Chau and Kontominas
2018]. The delivery drivers were divided into batches, where Batch 1 consisted of the top 10% of
drivers, based on who worked the most hours on evenings and weekends. This batch got to choose
their shifts for the next period before the rest of the delivery drivers could. The poorest performing
batch, Batch 4, was left with the last pick of the next shifts. The batch system was found to be
evidence of Foodora exercising a high degree of control over its workers, meaning that they could be
seen as employees, not contractors. These distinctions threatened the business model of Foodora,
and similar companies, as they up until then could avoid paying costly employee entitlements, such
as annual leave, sick leave and superannuation.
At the same time, a group of Foodora delivery riders in Australia successfully sued the company,
arguing that they should have been classified as employees rather than independent contractors
[Tran and Marozzi 2018]. This ruling set a precedent for other similar cases in Australia and
around the world, as this would change the business model of those companies reliant on the gig
economy.
The strikes had an impact on Foodora’s financial performance, as the company faced increased
costs associated with addressing the concerns of its delivery riders and defending itself against the
mentioned legal challenges. In 2018, Foodora announced that it would be ceasing operations in
Australia, citing ”a distant position with the number one, and we could not provide the customer
an amazing experience given our scale” [Smyth 2018]. Later that year, Foodora’s parent company,
Delivery Hero, announced that it would be selling its food delivery business in France, Italy and
the Netherlands, claiming that “The rationale for the other three markets is similar” [Smyth 2018].
At that time Foodora owed over $8 million to different creditors and former employees [Chau and
Kontominas 2018].
The strikes against Foodora, and the broader movement for fair labour practices in the gig economy
that they were part of, significantly impacted the evolution of the platform ecosystems of companies
like Foodora. Prior to the strikes, companies like Foodora were able to operate with relatively little
4
regulatory oversight, relying on the classification of their workers as independent contractors to
avoid providing benefits and minimum wage protections. However, the strikes and associated legal
challenges brought attention to the issue of worker classification and put pressure on companies
to reexamine their labour practices. They have also contributed to a more complex regulatory
environment for gig economy companies. In many jurisdictions, there is an ongoing debate over
how to classify gig economy workers and what types of protections they should be entitled to
(Spoke 2022). This has led to increased scrutiny and regulation of gig economy companies, and in
some cases, companies like Foodora have chosen to exit certain markets [Nium 2021].
Overall, the strikes against Foodora were a significant turning point in the evolution of the platform
ecosystems of gig economy companies, contributing to increased regulation and scrutiny and driving
changes in labour practices and benefits for gig economy workers.
4.3 Episode 3: Covid
The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting home delivery boom had a significant impact on
Foodora’s business. With people staying at home and restaurants closed for in-person dining,
there was a surge in demand for food delivery services, and Foodora was well-positioned to meet
this demand. The platform saw a significant increase in orders, particularly in the Nordic countries
where it operates.
Foodora’s focus on quick and reliable delivery, as well as its broad selection of restaurant options,
made it a popular choice for customers during the pandemic. The platform also expanded its
services to include grocery delivery, which further boosted its popularity among customers who
were unable or unwilling to leave their homes.
The increased demand for food delivery services also provided an opportunity for Foodora to
expand its business and increase its market share. The platform continued to invest in technology
and infrastructure to improve its delivery capabilities, and it partnered with more restaurants and
grocery stores to offer a wider selection of products to customers.
Overall, the home delivery boom caused by the COVID-19 pandemic provided a significant boost
to Foodora’s business and helped to solidify its position as a leading player in the food delivery
market. The platform’s ability to adapt to changing market conditions and meet the needs of
customers was a key factor in its success during this time.
4.4 Episode 4: Foodora markets
Foodora Markets is a new grocery concept launched by Foodora in early 2021. With this launch,
Foodora went away from being a pure restaurant delivery service into entering the wholesale trade.
The concept revolves around customers browsing and ordering grocery items exclusively online in
the app or webpage. The ordered goods are then picked up by a delivery driver, similar to when
ordering from a restaurant, and delivered from Foodora markets’ own ”dark stores”. Even as a
relatively new feature, Foodora markets have currently grown to include 10 stores in operation and
over 2500 product lines in Norway [foodora market 2022].
The implementation of Foodora market into the Foodora ecosystem can be viewed as an alternative
approach to creating a lock-in. Ultimately, the addition of more diverse functionality is meant to
make the platform more valuable for all users. This is because the platform now can be used as
both a delivery service for dishes from restaurants and grocery items.
Furthermore, using the Foodora name and brand to launch such a feature makes the functionality
more accessible to users that already have used Foodora before. This is a result of users being
more likely to hear about and try functionality that is closely related to known features. Users
are familiar with how the system works, as well as trust that the items are delivered in a timely
manner.
The addition of Foodora market has further positioned Foodora as a leading vendor within the
5
delivery space in the Nordic countries. The constantly expanding range of functionalities in the
Foodora ecosystem ultimately makes switching to a competing platform more unappealing than
staying with the platform for most users.
5 Conclusion
This delivery has detailed some of the most important events in the evolution of Foodora. Four
events along the timeline were described in greater detail to gain a deeper knowledge of the plat-
form. These were the acquisition by DeliveryHero, worker strikes, boost under the Covid-19 pan-
demic and the opening of Foodora markets. Lastly, three modular operators which have had an
impact on the development and incremental refinement of Foodora are listed. This includes the
operators augment, mutate and substitute.
