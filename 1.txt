1 Platform Ecosystem
Foodora is a digital marketplace that leverages the power of online platforms and mobile technology
to connect customers with local restaurants. Through its platform, customers can browse menus,
place orders, and pay for their meals, while restaurants can receive orders and manage their
inventory and delivery schedules. The platform also employs a fleet of delivery drivers, who are
hired as independent contractors, to pick up orders from restaurants and deliver them to customers.
As a transaction-based platform ecosystem, Foodora generates revenue by charging fees to both
restaurants and customers. Restaurants typically pay a commission on each order they receive
through the platform, while customers may be charged a delivery fee or a service fee. The platform
also offers subscription-based services and other value-added features to its customers and partners.
The Foodora platform ecosystem complies with the definitions of a platform ecosystem in that it
serves as a foundation for interactions and transactions between different stakeholders, including
customers, restaurants, and delivery drivers. The platform enables these stakeholders to exchange
value, in the form of food orders, through a shared digital marketplace.
The Foodora platform ecosystem is interesting to study for several reasons. First, it represents a
disruptive force in the food delivery industry, which has traditionally relied on phone orders and
in-house delivery services. By providing a digital marketplace for food orders, Foodora has enabled
restaurants to reach a broader customer base and expand their operations. At the same time, the
platform has given customers greater choice and convenience in the food ordering process.
Second, Foodora has faced legal and regulatory challenges related to the status of its delivery
drivers as independent contractors. In several countries, including Canada and Australia, courts
and labour regulators have ruled that Foodora drivers are employees and entitled to the rights and
benefits that come with that status. This has implications not only for Foodora but also for the
broader gig economy, which relies heavily on independent contractors to deliver services through
digital platforms.
Finally, the acquisition of Foodora by Delivery Hero in 2018 highlights the competitive dynamics
within the food delivery market and the consolidation that is taking place among digital market-
places. As platform ecosystems continue to grow and evolve, it will be important to study these
dynamics and their implications for competition, innovation, and regulation in the digital economy.
Foodora’s platform ecosystem is in the post-dominant design stage of its platform lifecycle. It
has already gained significant traction among its user base, as evidenced by its large number of
customers, restaurants, and delivery drivers who participate in the ecosystem. However, there is
still room for growth and innovation, particularly as the platform expands into new geographic
markets and introduces new features and services.
One of the key drivers of Foodora’s growth and success is the network effects that it generates.
As more customers, restaurants, and delivery drivers join the platform, the value of the ecosystem
increases for all stakeholders. This is particularly evident in the same-side network effects that
exist between customers and restaurants. As more customers use the platform to order food, more
restaurants are incentivized to join in order to capture a share of the growing market. This, in turn,
makes the platform more valuable to customers by increasing the variety and quality of restaurants
available. Other-side network effects also exist between customers and delivery drivers, as well as
between restaurants and delivery drivers.
2 Actors involved
Foodora’s platform ecosystem consists of several groups of participants, namely platform owners,
app developers, consumers, delivery drivers, restaurants and retailers. Each of these participants
has a unique set of needs and motivations for participating on the platform. As a result, the
platform has to uniquely appeal to each of the groups in how it aligns with their interests relative
to the service that is provided.
1
2.1 Platform Owners
Foodora is owned by Delivery Hero, a major online food delivery service based in Germany that
operates in over 50 countries in Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle east. Delivery Hero
consists of multiple companies with food delivery as their main area of focus. Their goal is to
expand their market share, find innovative solutions and ultimately increase their profit.
2.1.1 The interests and engagement of platform owners
Delivery Hero bought Foodora in 2015 with an interest in being the biggest food delivery in Europe.
Since Foodora already had a solid foundation with its own infrastructure, such an acquisition
led Delivery Hero to achieve a much stronger lead in the European delivery market. Since the
acquisition, Foodora is still run as a separate company, however, the increase in available resources
from the mother company enables growth and capital to keep innovating and finding new ways to
be more effective.
2.1.2 Platform owners influence on the platform ecosystem
Since Delivery Hero is the owner of Foodora, Foodora is dependant on its owner to invest in its
technology, business model and how it should operate. Foodora is on their side obligated to report
to Delivery Hero on how the company is doing and share their profits. Delivery Hero is therefore
a great force which influences the platform ecosystem through financial support.
2.2 App developers
Developers are actors that create, maintain and develop the Foodora application for IOS, Android
and the web. Developers of the Foodora ecosystem are either consultants hired for the job, or
in-house developers working directly for Foodora.
2.2.1 The interests and engagement of app developers
Developers are necessary in order for Foodora to operate. Developers are in charge of keeping the
platform online, as well as implementing new features when the company decides to do so. De-
velopers working for Foodora might be interested in the technology stack that Foodora implements
and the salary that the job offers. Developers’ interests can vary depending on their personal
interests as well as the position they have.
2.2.2 App developers influence on the platform ecosystem
Developers that are working with the Foodora platform could have a major influence on the
platform ecosystem, depending on the position that they hold in the company. Developers of-
ten implement ideas that come from product developers but can often have the right to discuss
and modify features that seem unrealistic or non-effective. Developers’ influence on the Foodora
platform is therefore extensive since developers are the backbone of the technology stack.
App developers are greatly involved in the Platform lifecycle of the Foodora Application, influencing
both how the application is designed and how it is developed. Developers also lay the foundation
for how the application is supposed to grow alongside competitors, new technology and the current
state of the application [Gawer 2018]. Considering the s-curve model and the maturity of the
technology and food delivery market, It is clear that Foodora is on a rise with new features being
constantly pushed to customers with new designs and trends kept in mind.

2.3 Consumers
Users (or consumers) are actors that consume the platform’s value proposition [Tiwana 2014].
Users of Foodora utilise the platform in order to buy food or grocery items from the different
restaurants or retailers that operate on the platform.
2.3.1 The interests and engagement of consumers
Foodora appeals to consumers by simplifying the process of browsing, purchasing and delivering
food straight to the consumers’ desired locations. This reduces the time and effort of having to
research and seek out both restaurant and dish, as well as having to physically pick up the food
at the restaurant. As a result, the platform appeals to people who wants to save time and energy
while making food choices.
Using Foodora’s website or mobile application, customers can discover which restaurants are near
them, place their food orders, and pay electronically. The order is then cooked by the restaurant
and prepared for either pick-up or delivery. If delivery is chosen, the order is picked up by one of
Foodora’s own delivery drivers and delivered directly to the customer’s chosen location. If pick-
up is selected then Foodora is only used as an interface for ordering and payment between the
restaurant and the user.
Users are limited to ordering and being delivered food within a restaurant’s opening hours, however,
they can always browse the different selections and place orders for delivery up to two days in
advance. Restaurants can be sorted by recommended, distance or fastest delivery. Furthermore,
the user can filter restaurants based on the type of cuisine or dietary preferences. The user can
also filter based on economic factors such as price point, deals or free delivery. The use of filters
makes it quick and easy for the consumer to choose which restaurant to shop from.
In addition to ordering food from restaurants, users can shop for household and grocery items from
the Foodora market. The concept is the same as for restaurants with users choosing which items
to buy in the application and these being delivered to a selected location. It is not possible to
choose pick-up on an order from Foodora marked. There are also some regular stores available,
however, this selection is still relatively small in comparison to the selection of restaurants.
2.3.2 Consumers influence on the platform ecosystem
The value of platforms acting as marketplaces will primarily be driven by positive network effects.
Network effects refer to how the technology’s usefulness increases as the installed base of users
increase. Network effects are either cross- or same-sided, meaning that the value of the platform
depends on either the number of users in the same user group or in different user groups [Reuver
et al. 2018].
Foodora’s primary goal is to help restaurants and consumers locate, interact and exchange value,
possibly through the use of a delivery driver, in a mutually beneficial manner. As a result, the
value of Foodora is driven by cross-sided network effects. The value of Foodora for consumers
increases as the number and selection of restaurants grow. The increase in users on the platform
will in return boost the motivation for more restaurants to establish themselves on the platform.
The increase of both mentioned actors will increase the number of delivery drivers needed.
The cycle of growth that comes from network effects increases the value of the platform for all
types of actors present. However, in order for the effects to manifest it requires reaching a critical
mass or tipping point [Tiwana 2014]. For an established site such as Foodora, it can be argued
that this mass is achieved, but for new platforms, this might be the biggest challenge faced by
platform owners face.

2.4 Delivery Drivers
Delivery drivers are the actors who work for Foodora and deliver the products from the restaurants
or retailers to the consumer’s selected location. Drivers use their own means of transport, e.g.
bicycles or cars, to deliver the food and receive orders directly through the Foodora application.
2.4.1 The interests and engagement of delivery drivers
The interests of delivery drivers are based heavily on economic factors, as being a delivery driver
is a job. The main reasons for having the job might vary amount the drivers. Some drivers use
bikes and combine the job with spending time outdoors, while others drive cars and prefer flexible
hours and being able to control their own working days. The most important reason for being a
delivery driver, and the main interest, is the economic compensation given by Foodora. Delivery
drivers are paid based on how many deliveries they are able to accomplish in their shift.
2.4.2 Delivery drivers influence on the platform ecosystem
Delivery drivers are paid based on how many deliveries they are able to accomplish in their shift.
Because of this, their main interest in the application is that it aids in the delivery of the most
amount of orders. As a result, the delivery drivers use another Foodora app than the consumers.
This application should facilitate the drivers in starting their shifts by choosing the kind of vehicle
they use and what kinds of orders they are able to pick up. The application should then give an
overview of relevant orders and what time they are ready for pick-up. Furthermore, the drivers
should be able to mark orders as delivered, or swap orders with other delivery drivers.
The delivery drivers can directly influence the application by giving constant feedback to Foodora
as to what they would like incorporated. Changes to this application are most likely not going to
influence the consumer’s application. Furthermore, drivers play a role in growing the platform’s
market share by being an actor that influences cross-side network effects as mentioned in section
2.3.2.
2.5 Restaurants & Retailers
While Foodora delivers a service, the restaurants and retailers are the actors who provide the
products within that service. They utilise the platform in order to sell their goods, without having
to deal directly with a customer.
2.5.1 The interests and engagement of restaurants & retailers
The restaurants and retailers are involved with Foodora because it helps them reach out to a larger
group of consumers. Restaurants can sell more food without having to have room for more guests
in their restaurants, and retailers can sell their goods to customers who might not have gone to
their stores. The restaurants and retailers could have had their own delivery service, but this would
cost more as they would need to hire couriers, as well as pay for delivery vehicles and the upkeep
of these. It would also require a system for keeping track of deliveries, which both takes time to
implement and learn, as well as costs money.
When a customer has placed an order, the restaurant or retailer in question gets a notification on
a tablet they have gotten from Foodora, with an app that is different from the apps the consumers
and delivery drivers use [Foodora 2023]. This notification shows an estimated time of arrival of a
delivery driver. The restaurant/retailer can choose to accept or refuse the order. If they accept,
they start preparing the order in time for the delivery driver to pick it up. When the order is
prepared, they mark the order as done, so that the delivery driver can come and pick it up.

Foodora handles the payments from the consumers and pays the restaurants and retailers based
on these payments four times a month, withdrawing the service fee the restaurants and retailers
have to pay to have their businesses on Foodora.
2.5.2 Restaurants & retailers influence on the platform ecosystem
The restaurants and retailers have, as the delivery drivers, their own application where they get
notifications and can communicate with Foodora. This means that their technical feedback might
not influence the app the consumers use. However, the restaurants would probably like to have
their goods shown clearly to the customer. If the restaurant feels like Foodora hides or deprioritises
its food, it might be persuaded to go over to other food delivery apps.
Foodora should consider if there are ways to make it more desirable for the restaurants on the
app to stay on the app, and not go over to other delivery services. This is known as lock-in and
can be either coercive or value-driven [Tiwana 2014]. Value-driven lock-in is based on making the
platform increasingly more valuable to its users so that their wants and needs for changing the
platform are minimized. The restaurants would probably prefer this kind of lock-in, as Foodora
then would make solutions as easy and cost-effective as possible for the restaurants, rather than
making high switching costs, which would be the case with coercive lock-in.
As mentioned in 2.3.2, the value aspect for the restaurants will also increase when the value for
the customer increase. This is because more consumers will use the platform, and as a result,
restaurants and retailers can sell to more customers. This is also made possible by having more
delivery drivers, as mentioned in 2.4.2.
3 Conclusion
To conclude, several actors participate in Foodora’s platform ecosystem. Each of these has different
needs that must be addressed by Foodora in order for the platform to grow and create the most
amount of value. Especially important is the reliability of cross-side network effects between
consumers, restaurants and delivery drivers in order to increase market share. All of these actors
will in one way or another grow with the increase in the number of other actors.
